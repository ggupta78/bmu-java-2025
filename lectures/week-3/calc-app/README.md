2. On receiving an input from the user, it should check for valid input, and display appropriate messages

3. If choice is 3. Exit, it should stop the program

4. If choice <= 1 or choice is >= 3, it should show 'Incorrect choice, please try again' and again ask for input

5. If choice is valid, i.e. either 1 or 2, then it should ask the user for two integer numbers

6. Once user enters two numbers, the corresponding operation should be performed and the result should be displayed

7. After the result is shown the menu should be re-displayed

1. The menu should always be displayed after clearing the screen, so that menu always displays on top of the screen
